# About Boolean Logics
Boolean Logics is a language of true or false. It consists of multiple logic gates such as and gates, or gates, not gates, nand gates and more. It gives different scenarios and simply gives an answer of true or false
## About logic gates
And gates - It works like X is false and Y is true. The and being the main part
For example in a scenario of which spoiled milk and good milk. The spoiled milk will be false and good milk will be true. Cup 1 is spoilt and Cup 2 is good. X = False, Y = true

Or gates - It work like X is true or Y is false. The or being the main part
For example the interent isnt working or the router isnt working
That is x is false and y is false

Not gates - it is a combination of not and or gates for example: x = true or y=true = not(true) = false

Nand gates - This is a combination of not and and
### How it works
Their are formulas for each
And gates - 
X = FALSE and Y = FALSE. : FALSE 
X = TRUE and Y = TRUE : TRUE 
X = FALSE and Y = TRUE : FALSE
X = TRUE and Y = FALSE: FALSE

Or gates
X = false or Y = falsE: False
X = True or Y = False : True
X = False or Y = True: True
X = True or Y = True: True
